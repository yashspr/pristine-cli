#   1. The full reverse-DNS id appears in the line. Self-identifying, so a
#      plain substring is enough.
#   2. The last DNS label appears as a DELIMITED token AND the same line
#      independently names another component of the id. Corroboration is what

#      cache to a running Claude. Measured on this machine before the change,
#      34 of 59 idle caches were called busy; the plain-substring shapes it
#      relied on also read "default" out of syncdefaultsd and "data" out of
#      dataaccessd.
#
# Shape 2 cannot tell sibling channels apart: every Brave Origin Nightly line
# carries "Brave" and "Nightly", so com.brave.Browser.nightly stayed busy for
# as long as the other channel ran, and its cache directory (610 MB of
# abandoned Sparkle downloads on one machine) was never reclaimed. A line whose
# executable lives in an app bundle is therefore attributed by that bundle's
